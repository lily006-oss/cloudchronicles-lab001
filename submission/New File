S is Situation
A regional outage has impact the us-central1 region in Google Cloud Platform (GCP). This region hosts critical components of a web application including:

Cloud SQL (Primary)

App Engine / GKE workloads

Cloud Storage buckets

Cloud Pub/Sub message flows

The outage has caused application downtime, data unavailability, and delayed message processing, directly impacting business operations and end-user experience.

T is Task
Design and implement a resilient disaster recovery (DR) and failover plan that ensures:

The High availability and the loss of minimal data 

Automated failover and alerting

Seamless recovery of core services and workloads

The plan must use Google Cloud-native tools and best practices for multi-region resilience.

A is Action
1. Database Recovery – Cloud SQL
Pre-outage setup:

Deploy a Cloud SQL cross-region read replica in us-east1.

Enable automated backups and point-in-time recovery.

Replication type: Async, but consider High Availability (HA) with external failover tools like Cloud SQL Proxy with health checks.

During outage:

Promote the read replica in us-east1 to become the new primary using the gcloud sql instances promote-replica command.

Update application connection strings (via secret manager or config maps) to point to the new primary.

2. Storage Recovery – Cloud Storage
Pre-outage setup:

Store static and critical files in Multi-Region Cloud Storage buckets (e.g., us, nam4).

Enable Object Versioning to prevent accidental data overwrites.

Use Bucket Lock policies for compliance-critical data.

During outage:

Since multi-region storage is not tied to a single region, applications can continue accessing assets with no change.

3. Application Compute Failover
Pre-outage setup:

Use GKE Autopilot or App Engine flexible environment with deployments in multi-regions (us-east1, us-west1).

Use Cloud Load Balancer with multi-region backends and health checks to route traffic to healthy services.

During outage:

Traffic automatically rerouted by the load balancer to healthy backends outside us-central1.

4. Messaging & Event Processing – Cloud Pub/Sub
Pre-outage setup:

Design Pub/Sub topics to be global, decoupling publishers and subscribers from region affinity.

Subscribers (e.g., Cloud Functions, Dataflow) should be deployed in at least two regions.

During outage:

Messages published to global topics are stored durably and can be processed once subscriber services in healthy regions recover or scale up.

5. Monitoring & Alerting
Use Cloud Monitoring and Alerting to:

Detect region-specific service degradation.

Send alerts via Pub/Sub, which can trigger:

Cloud Functions for automation (e.g., failover steps)

Notification channels (email, Slack, SMS)

Sample Pub/Sub-based automation:

Trigger a Cloud Function on alert to promote a Cloud SQL replica.

Modify DNS records (using Cloud DNS) via API to redirect traffic.

R - Result
With this plan:

Database downtime is minimized (~1-2 minutes) with a read replica promotion.

Application uptime is preserved via load-balanced multi-region compute.

Data remains accessible due to multi-region storage.

Messaging services continue without disruption.

Automated alerts and actions reduce manual intervention and recovery time.

RTO (Recovery Time Objective) is under 5 minutes.

RPO (Recovery Point Objective) is near zero depending on replication lag.
